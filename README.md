# BuildingBlocks
A simple Minecraft clone based on my homework project. Added a couple of new features and had it posted here on my Github page after the project is due, so I'll for sure pick this project up again and improve more on it later on.

..kinda had fun making it too, tbh..

## Download
v0.1.4 of the project is ready to be downloaded and played around. Link below pointing to the Github release page.

## Does it work?
Of course!

Left mouse click to start building blocks, and right mouse click to undo building. Use the guiding cube to see where the cube will be build exactly.

Arrow keys (and + LeftShift/RightShift) can rotates and moves the camera around, but the implementation was still like an afterthought kinda thing, and will be improved in the future build.

If you accidentally opened the game in fullscreen, Escape key will save the day and exit the game beautifully.. :P

## Where's the project came from?
It's a homework for my COMP465 Graphics class. The main requirements was to be able to build the cubes on the base, and extending from the already build cubes. The translucent-colored "guiding cube" was the extra credit part of the homework, which thankfully I managed to fit that in before the due.

Other than those, the project feels kinda fun to me so I'll definitely add more functionality to this to kill some time later in the future.
